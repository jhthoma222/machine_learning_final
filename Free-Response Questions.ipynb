    "A critical part of machine learning is making sense of your analysis process and communicating it to others. The questions below will help us understand your decision-making process and allow us to give feedback on your project. Please answer each question; your answers should be about 1-2 paragraphs per question. If you find yourself writing much more than that, take a step back and see if you can simplify your response!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When your evaluator looks at your responses, he or she will use a specific list of rubric items to assess your answers. Here is the link to that rubric: [Link] Each question has one or more specific rubric items associated with it, so before you submit an answer, take a look at that part of the rubric. If your response does not meet expectations for all rubric points, you will be asked to revise and resubmit your project. Make sure that your responses are detailed enough that the evaluator will be able to understand the steps you took and your thought processes as you went through the data analysis.\n",

    "Question 1: \n",
    "Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those? [relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”]\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to use machine learning to identify persons of interest (POIs) in the Enron corporate fraud case. We were given a dataset with 146 data points with 21 features. The data points are people within the enron organization. The features were financial features (such as salary, bonus, and stock options) and email features (such as number of messages sent, messages sent to POIs, and number of messages received). Of the 146 people in the data set 18 of them were Persons of Interest (POI's). Using machine learning to identify the POIs is useful because of complexity of the data set. It allows us to try to find patterns to detect POIs. In this way, we can create a model that then may help us identify POIs from new data -- if a new person and their data are sent through the model, the model can then identify whether that new person may be a POI or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the Python scikit-learn package to create our models. We first loaded our data into a Python dictionary, called data_dict. One of the first steps was to remove outliers from the data. I removed two data points before continuing to create the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "data_dict.pop('TOTAL',0)\n",
    "\n",
    "I removed the 'TOTAL' line because that's merely a spreadsheet tally line for the other 145 data records.  I also considered removing Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling from the data, because their financial features in particular are large outliers when compared to the rest of the data; however, I decided to leave their records in the data because they are an important part of the Enron story -- if you can't identify those two as POIs, then the Enron story completely changes! I also considered removing \"The Travel Agency in the Park,\" which is a \"person\" in our data; however, I left that line in because in a legal sense, sometimes businesses can be considered as a person. So if we have a POI that's actually a business, that could be valid information to know as well.\n",

    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2:\n",
    "What features did you end up using in your POI identifier, and what selection process did you use to pick them? Did you have to do any scaling? Why or why not? As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it. (You do not necessarily have to use it in the final analysis, only engineer and test it.) In your feature selection step, if you used an algorithm like a decision tree, please also give the feature importances of the features that you use, and if you used an automated feature selection function like SelectKBest, please report the feature scores and reasons for your choice of parameter values.  [relevant rubric items: “create new features”, “intelligently select features”, “properly scale features”]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the most effective features for classification I decided to use “Decision Tree” to rank the features. First I put all the possible features into features_list.  I then used the top 10 from the previous decision tree ranking.  Which was the following:    features_list = [\"poi\", 'salary', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus','restricted_stock_deferred','deferred_income', 'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'exercised_stock_options']\n",
    "I then took the top 5 of the previous ranking and came up with the following:    features_list = [\"poi\", 'salary', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'bonus']\n",

What parameters did you tune?
